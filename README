NAME
    RT::Extension::MergeUsers - Merges two users into the same effective
    user

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension adds a "Merge Users" box to the User Administration
    page, which allows you to merge the user you are currently viewing with
    another user on your RT instance.

    It also adds "MergeInto" and "UnMerge" functions to the RT::User class,
    which allow you to programmatically accomplish the same thing from your
    code.

    It also provides a version of CanonicalizeEmailAddress, which means that
    all e-mail sent from secondary users is displayed as coming from the
    primary user.

INSTALLATION
    If you're upgrading then, as well, read "UPGRADING" below.

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install
        clear your mason cache
            most often this would be rm -rf /opt/rt3/var/mason_data/*
        restart apache

    For RT 3.8

        Add RT::Extension::MergeUsers to your /opt/rt3/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm file
        Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::MergeUsers));

        If you have more than one Plugin enabled, you must enable them as one
        Set(@Plugins, qw(Foo Bar)); command

UPGRADING
    If you are upgrading from 0.03_01 or earlier, you must run
    rt-upgrade-merged-users. This script will create MergedUsers Attributes
    so RT can know when you're looking at a user that other users have been
    merged into. If you don't run this script, you'll have issues unmerging
    users. It can be safely run multiple times, it will only create
    Attributes as needed.

  Next
    This custom iterator makes sure that duplicate users are never shown in
    search results.
